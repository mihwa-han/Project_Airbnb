## Motivation

The goal of this project is to analyze the importance of all of these factors using the InsideAirbnb dataset. The data includes vital statistics on the listings like location, description, size, price, amenities, and reviews. 

## Data
The data comes from a public website called InsideAirbnb (http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html), which compiles a multitude of data on every Airbnb listing in 16 major cities in the US (totaling around 1.7GB).
